This project has been discontinued, it will only recieve updates for updates that Discord may do to their platform that may break parts of the code.

Powercord support will be dropped in 3.2 because Powercord is trash (well, the devs; the codebase is ok ig), use Goosemod or Cumcord.

# Drakula
## Yet another Dracula theme for Discord

![Picture taken with Goosemod and some mods](/ast/FrontPage-v3.png "Drakula 3.2")

# About
This is Drakula, a Discord theme that focuses on delivering the best user experience while maintaining as much vanilla elements as possible.

Drakula is a fork of [Zeno Rocha's Dracula BetterDiscord theme](https://github.com/dracula/betterdiscord) with mods and snippets to make it as minimalistic and cozy as possible. This culminates in one of the dumbest Discord themes out there. 

# Added modifications
The following mods to Discord have been added for your pleasure:

1. Change default font to Fira Code (you can change this through CustomCSS if you don't like it)
2. Change default status badge thingy colours
3. General UI colour changes
4. Code Blocks have proper Synthax Highlighting
5. Scrollbar for long custom statuses
6. Removing the text from the general server pop-up (its now only icons!)
7. General pop-ups like Server Names and such colour tuned to fit the Dracula colour scheme
8. HTTPS and HTTP differentiators!

# Installation
Installing Drakula is pretty simple and intuitive, just follow these steps for your mod:

If you're using GooseMod, just search up for Drakula in your "Themes" section and hit "Import"

If you're using another client mod (say BeautifulDiscord, Vizality, Powercord, etc), Install the theme like you usually do, just note that I will ***not*** be offering any support for other clients not mentioned above.
