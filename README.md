# SeaSixty
## Yet another Dracula theme for Discord

![This is SeaSixty](/ast/FrontPage-v1.2.1.png)

# About
SeaSixty is C69's Personal Theme that can also be used as general theme!

The theme overall is just a fork of [Zeno Rocha's Dracula BetterDiscord theme](https://github.com/dracula/betterdiscord) with a few modifications to make it more "cozy"

# What are the so called "modifications"
The "so called modifications" are just some life improvements to make Discord look better and cozier (say, a scroll bar for long statuses).

This is a watered down list of modifications, more will come soon!:

1. Change default font to Cascadia Code
2. Change default status badge thingy colours
3. General UI colour changes
4. Code Blocks have proper Synthax Highlighting
5. Scrollbar for long custom statuses
6. Removing the text from the general server pop-up (its now only icons!)
7. General pop-ups like Server Names and such colour tuned to fit Dracula
8. Other funky stuff 2b added down the line

# How do I install it?

For Powercord just clone the repo into your themes folder like this:

```
git clone ~/(where you installed Powercord)/powercord/src/Powercord/Themes
```

For BeautifulDiscord you just install the theme like you normally do. (some snippets and imports might not work as intended)

For other clients you'll need to do some shenanigans to make it work, copying the entire source code or doing an @import on Custom CSS normally works; I will **NOT** not offer any support for BetterDiscord (don't use BD) or other clients.
