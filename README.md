# About
This is Drakula, a Discord theme that focuses on delivering the best user experience while maintaining as much vanilla elements as possible.

Drakula is a fork of [Zeno Rocha's Dracula BetterDiscord theme](https://github.com/dracula/betterdiscord) with mods and snippets to make it as minimalistic and cozy as possible. This culminates in one of the dumbest Discord themes out there. 

# Added modifications
At the Kritterhouse, we like experimenting with everything, from USB drives on the ground to ~~keyboards for rythm games~~.
And Discord themes are no exception, so we decided to spice things up and add the following mods for your enjoyment:

1. Change default font to Fira Code
2. Change default status badge thingy colours
3. General UI colour changes
4. Code Blocks have proper Synthax Highlighting
5. Scrollbar for long custom statuses
6. Removing the text from the general server pop-up (its now only icons!)
7. General pop-ups like Server Names and such colour tuned to fit Dracula
8. HTTPS and HTTP differentiators!
8. Other funky stuff 2b added down the line

# Installation

Installing Drakula is pretty simple and intuitive, just follow these steps for your mod:

If you're using GooseMod, just search up for Drakula in your "Themes" section and hit "Import"

If you're using Powercord do this:

```git clone https://github.com/citizensixtynine/drakula powercord/src/Powercord/themes```

If you're using another client mod (say BeautifulDiscord, Vizality, etc), Install the theme like you usually do, just note that I will ***not*** be offering any support for other clients not mentioned above.
